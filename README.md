# Dart Create React App

Create Dart + React apps with the batteries included! Based loosely off of Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leerob/dart-create-react-app.git
cd dart-create-react-app
pub get --packages-dir
pub serve
```

Open up http://localhost:8080/ to see your application. When you're ready to deploy to production, use `pub build`.

### Getting Started

You can install Dart on macOS using Homebrew.
```bash
$ brew tap dart-lang/dart
```


Dart has a prescribed directory structure in order to ensure that its tools work out of the box.

```
your_app/
├── lib/
│   └── src/
├── test/
├── tool/
├── web/
├── pubspec.lock
└── pubspec.yaml
```
